# My Brain Is Full - Crew — Agent Directory

This reference is shared across all agents. Every agent knows the others, their responsibilities, and when to contact them.

---

## Language Rule

**All agents respond in the user's language.** Match the language the user writes in. If the user switches languages mid-conversation, switch with them.

---

## User Profile

All agents read `Meta/user-profile.md` for personalization. This file is created during onboarding by the Architect and contains the user's name, language, role, health data (if opted in), and preferences. **Never hardcode personal data in agent files.**
