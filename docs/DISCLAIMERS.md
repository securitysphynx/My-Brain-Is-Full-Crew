## I'm not an expert

Let me be upfront: **I am not a Claude Code expert.** I'm a PhD researcher who needed help and built something that works for me. This project is an accumulation of personal needs, not a polished product from someone who knows all the best practices.

The code might not be optimal. The prompts might not be perfect. The architecture might make a seasoned Claude developer cringe. **And that's okay.** I'm sharing this because I believe it can help other people in my same situation, not because I think it's the definitive way to do things.

If you know Claude Code better than I do — and chances are you do — **please contribute.** Every PR is welcome. Every suggestion, every critique, every improvement. I want this to get better, and I know it will get better faster with help from people who actually know what they're doing.

## On the health and wellness agents

> **This needs to be crystal clear, so I'm going to say it plainly.**

The **Food Coach** and **Wellness Guide** agents are **AI-generated output. Nothing more.** They are not medical professionals. They are not licensed therapists. They are not dietitians. They are language models following instructions I wrote based on my own personal needs.

**I take absolutely no responsibility for the output of these agents.** Specifically:

- The Food Coach agent **does not provide medical advice.** Its meal plans, calorie calculations, and dietary suggestions are AI-generated and may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate for your specific health situation. **Always consult a real doctor or registered dietitian** before making changes to your diet, especially if you have medical conditions.

- The Wellness Guide agent **does not provide therapy.** It applies techniques from CBT, ACT, and Mindfulness based on publicly available frameworks, but it is **not a substitute for professional mental health care.** It cannot diagnose anything. It should never be your only source of support. **If you are in crisis, contact a real mental health professional or emergency service immediately.**

- The health agents are designed as **personal wellness companions** — think of them as a structured journal with suggestions, not as healthcare providers. They were built because I personally needed help tracking my nutrition and processing my thoughts between therapy sessions. They helped me. They might help you. But they come with **zero guarantees.**

- **No warranty, no liability.** This is an open-source project provided "as is". I am not responsible for any decisions you make based on the output of any agent in this system. Use your own judgment. Consult real professionals for real health decisions.

Both health agents are **opt-in** during onboarding. You can use the Crew purely for knowledge management if you prefer.

## General disclaimer

This project is provided **as is, with no warranty of any kind.** I don't guarantee that it works correctly, that it won't lose your notes, or that the agents will behave as described in every situation. It's a personal project that I'm sharing openly. Use it at your own risk, back up your vault, and **please open an issue** if something goes wrong so we can fix it together.

## On forks and misuse

This project was built to help people. That's it. It's meant to support overwhelmed individuals in organizing their lives, their health, and their mental wellbeing.

**I take no responsibility for forks, modifications, or derivative works** that use this code for purposes other than its original intent. If someone takes this project and repurposes it to manipulate, deceive, harm, or exploit people in any way — that's on them, not on me. I explicitly condemn any use of this work for malicious purposes, including but not limited to: unauthorized data collection, psychological manipulation, impersonation of medical or mental health professionals, or any form of exploitation.

This is a tool for self-care and personal organization. If you fork it, please keep it that way.
