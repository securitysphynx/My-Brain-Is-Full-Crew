# Getting Started with My Brain Is Full - Crew

A step-by-step guide for setting up your AI-powered vault — no technical background required.

---

## What you need before starting

### Required
- **Obsidian** — A free note-taking app. Download it at [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)
- **Claude Code** — Anthropic's coding assistant. You need a Claude Pro, Max, or Team subscription.
- **An Obsidian vault** — This is just a folder on your computer where Obsidian stores your notes. If you don't have one yet, Obsidian will create one for you when you first open it.
- **Git** — A tool to download the project. On Mac, the terminal will prompt you to install it automatically the first time you use it. On Windows, download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).

### Optional (but recommended)
- **Gmail account** — If you want the Postman agent to process your emails
- **Google Calendar** — If you want calendar integration

---

## Step 1: Install Obsidian

1. Go to [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) and download the app for your system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
2. Open Obsidian
3. If this is your first time, click **"Create new vault"**
4. Give it a name (e.g., "My Brain", "Second Brain", "Knowledge Base" — whatever feels right)
5. Choose where to save it on your computer
6. Remember this location — you'll need it in Step 3

### Install recommended plugins

Inside Obsidian:
1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon, bottom left)
2. Click **Community plugins**
3. Click **Browse**
4. Search for and install these plugins:

**Essential (install these first):**
| Plugin | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Templater** | Makes templates work with dynamic content (dates, etc.) |
| **Dataview** | Lets you query your notes like a database |
| **Calendar** | Visual calendar in the sidebar |
| **Tasks** | Better task management with due dates and queries |

**Recommended (install when ready):**
| Plugin | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **QuickAdd** | Rapid note capture |
| **Folder Notes** | Index notes for folders |
| **Tag Wrangler** | Manage and rename tags in bulk |
| **Periodic Notes** | Weekly and monthly review notes |
| **Omnisearch** | Better search across your vault |

Don't worry if this feels like a lot — the Architect agent will remind you about missing plugins during setup.

## Step 2: Install Claude Code

1. Go to [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) and follow the instructions to install Claude Code
2. You need a **Claude Pro**, **Max**, or **Team** subscription
3. You can use either the **Desktop app** (Cowork) or the **CLI** (command-line interface) — the Crew works on both

---

## Step 3: Install the Crew

Open your terminal and navigate to your Obsidian vault folder:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-vault
```

> **Not sure how to open the terminal?** On Mac, press `Command + Space`, type "Terminal", and press Enter. On Windows, press `Windows + R`, type "cmd", and press Enter.

Clone the repo inside your vault:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gnekt/My-Brain-Is-Full-Crew.git
```

Run the installer:

```bash
cd My-Brain-Is-Full-Crew
bash scripts/launchme.sh
```

The script will ask two quick questions:
1. **Is this your vault folder?** — confirm or enter the correct path
2. **Do you use Gmail or Google Calendar?** — choose yes to set up the Postman integration

When it's done, your vault will look like this:

```
your-vault/
├── .claude/
│   ├── agents/          ← 10 crew agents (Claude Code CLI)
│   ├── skills/          ← 10 crew skills (Claude Code Desktop / Cowork)
│   └── references/      ← shared docs the agents read
├── CLAUDE.md            ← project instructions
├── .mcp.json            ← Gmail + Calendar (only if you said yes)
├── My-Brain-Is-Full-Crew/  ← the repo (for future updates)
└── ... your Obsidian notes
```

> **Something went wrong?** The most common issue is that `git` isn't installed. On Mac, the terminal will prompt you to install it automatically. On Windows, download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com). If you're stuck, just show this page to a tech-savvy friend — it takes 60 seconds.

---

## Step 4: Connect your vault

1. Open Claude Code (CLI or Desktop)
2. Open it **inside your Obsidian vault folder** — this is important. Claude needs to be in your vault to read and write your notes.

If you're using the CLI:
```bash
cd /path/to/your-vault
claude
```

If you're using Claude Code Desktop (Cowork), open the vault folder as your working directory.

---

## Step 5: Initialize your vault

This is the fun part. Just type:

> **"Initialize my vault"**

The **Architect** agent will wake up and start a friendly conversation with you. It will ask:

### About you
- What should I call you?
- What's your preferred language?
- What do you do? (student, professional, creative, researcher...)
- What brought you here? (overwhelm, organization, health, productivity...)

### About your vault
- Are you new to Obsidian, or migrating from an existing vault?
- Do you want all 10 agents, or just some?
- What areas of your life do you want to manage?

### About your health (optional)
If you opt in to the health agents:
- **Food Coach setup**: height, weight, age, goals, dietary restrictions, food preferences
- **Wellness Guide setup**: whether you see a therapist, what concerns you want to address, preferred approaches

### About integrations (optional)
- Do you want email triage? (requires Gmail connection)
- Do you want calendar integration? (requires Google Calendar connection)

After the conversation, the Architect creates your entire vault structure, saves your profile, and leaves you a personalized welcome note.

## Step 6: Start using it

From now on, you just talk to Claude. Here are some things to try on your first day:

### Capture some thoughts
> "Save this: I had an idea about reorganizing the team standup — maybe we should do async updates on Mondays and only meet on Wednesdays"

The **Scribe** will turn this into a clean note in your inbox.

### Dump several things at once
> "Quick notes: need to call the dentist, also Marco mentioned a book called Thinking Fast and Slow, and I should review the Q3 budget before Friday"

The **Scribe** detects multiple items and creates separate notes for each.

### Check your email
> "Check my email for anything important"

The **Postman** scans your Gmail, saves actionable emails, and gives you a summary.

### File everything
> "Triage my inbox"

The **Sorter** processes all notes in your inbox and files them to the right places.

### Search your brain
> "What do I know about the Henderson project?"

The **Seeker** searches your vault and synthesizes an answer with source citations.

### Get meal ideas
> "What should I eat this week? I have chicken, rice, and a lot of vegetables in the fridge"

The **Food Coach** creates a personalized meal plan.

### Decompress
> "I'm feeling overwhelmed and can't focus"

The **Wellness Guide** guides you through grounding techniques.

## Step 7: Build daily habits

The Crew works best with simple daily routines:

### Morning (2 minutes)
> "Check my calendar for today" — see what's ahead
> "Any messages from the crew?" — check if agents flagged anything

### Throughout the day
> Just dump thoughts as they come. The Scribe handles the rest.

### Evening (5 minutes)
> "Triage my inbox" — let the Sorter file everything
> "How was my day?" — the Wellness Guide helps you reflect (optional)

### Weekly (10 minutes)
> "Weekly review" — the Librarian runs a full vault health check
> "Show my diet progress" — the Food Coach gives you a progress report (optional)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "The agent doesn't seem to activate"
Make sure Claude Code is open inside your vault folder (not a different directory). Verify the agent files exist at `.claude/agents/` in your vault. If you're using Cowork/Desktop, check that `.claude/skills/` was also created by the installer. Try saying the trigger phrase differently — agents understand natural language in multiple languages.

### "Gmail/Calendar isn't working"
The Postman needs Gmail and Google Calendar MCP connectors. Run the installer again (`bash scripts/launchme.sh`) and answer **yes** to the Gmail/Calendar question, or manually copy `.mcp.json` from the repo to your vault root. Then authorize the connection when Claude Code prompts you.

### "My vault structure looks different from the docs"
The Architect customizes the structure based on your onboarding answers. If you opted out of health agents, for example, the Health folder won't be created.

### "How do I update to a new version?"

```bash
cd /path/to/your-vault/My-Brain-Is-Full-Crew
git pull
bash scripts/updateme.sh
```

Only changed files are updated. Your vault notes are never touched.

### "An agent did something weird"
Open an issue on GitHub with:
1. What you asked
2. What happened
3. What you expected

### "I want to change my profile"
> "Update my profile" — the Architect will help you modify your settings
