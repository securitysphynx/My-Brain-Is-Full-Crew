## Scenario 1: The Brain Dump

**Situation**: You just got out of a meeting and your head is full of scattered thoughts.

**What happens:**
1. **Scribe** detects 4 distinct items
2. Creates 4 separate notes:
   - `Task — API Docs for Marco.md` (with deadline: Thursday, linked to `[[Marco]]`)
   - `Note — Budget Cut 15 Percent.md` (tagged with #budget, linked to `[[Lisa]]`)
   - `Idea — Webhooks for Notifications.md` (tagged with #architecture, #notifications)
   - `Task — Book Dentist Appointment.md` (tagged with #personal, #health)
3. All notes land in `00-Inbox/` with proper frontmatter
